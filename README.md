# Pomodoro-Clock
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. (Adopted from Wikipedia)

I wanted to complete this project using only Vanilla JS.

## User story:
Users can start a 25 minute pomodoro timer, customise it's length and reset the timer, ready for the next pomodoro.

Build an app functionaly similar to this https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
